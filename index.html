            whereAmI is an open source project to help you identify and take
            back control over where and who has your data. You should be able to
            browse, game, and enjoy the internet without giving away your
            privacy and protections. Click the button below to start regaining

            How does it work? We scrape through the most popular sale sites and
            find out who is selling your information. If available, we'll supply
            a link to disengage yourself from the website or service.

              Your activity on the internet is monitored almost from the first
              key stroke. The more add-ons and permissions that you allow, the

                Companies collect this data through the submissions to their
                website (ex. Facebook/Instagram), cookies, key logs, and local
                data storage. The permissions you allowed gave them ownership
                and permission of your data.
